# Simple sidescroller game
This is a simple sidescroller I built using a tutorial but heavily refactored to be object-oriented.

#TODO
- [x] Object Oriented
- [x] Serve using GitHub pages
- [ ] Add help on start
- [ ] Add tests
- [ ] Remove vue and use webpack-nano, webpack-plugin-serve
for hot reload.
- [ ] Fix jump velocity
- [ ] Camera concept so that platforms don't move initially until player reaches 400
- [ ] Custom graphics
- [ ] Support vertical play
